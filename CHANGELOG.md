## Test Results

### Current Test Status
- **Zyre Protocol**: ✅ 8 functions, 16 scenarios (100% pass rate)
- **Dafka Protocol**: ✅ 8 functions, 18 scenarios (100% pass rate)  
- **Malamute Protocol**: ✅ 10 functions, 25 scenarios (100% pass rate)

**Overall**: ✅ 26 functions, 59 scenarios (100% success rate)

## Version History

### v25.0.0 (Current)
- Initial major release
- Complete ØMQ 4.x protocol support
- Production-ready implementation
- Comprehensive security features
- High-level protocol implementations

## Migration Guide

### From External ZeroMQ Libraries

If migrating from C-based ZeroMQ bindings:

```go
// Old (external binding)
import "github.com/pebbe/zmq4"

// New (pure Go)
import "github.com/destiny/zmq4/v25"
```

Key differences:
- Pure Go implementation (no C dependencies)
- Different API patterns for socket creation
- Enhanced security options
- Built-in high-level protocols

### API Changes

#### Socket Creation
```go
// Old pattern
socket, _ := zmq4.NewSocket(zmq4.REQ)

// New pattern  
socket := zmq4.NewReq(ctx)
```

#### Message Handling
```go
// Old pattern
socket.SendMessage("hello", "world")

// New pattern
msg := zmq4.NewMsgString("hello")
socket.Send(msg)
```

## Breaking Changes

### v25.0.0
- Complete API redesign for Go idioms
- Context-based socket management
- New security mechanism APIs
- Protocol-specific package structure

## Known Issues

Currently no known issues. All test scenarios pass successfully.

## Roadmap

### Planned Features
- Enhanced monitoring and metrics
- Additional transport protocols
- Performance optimizations
- Extended security mechanisms

### Future Versions
- v25.1.0: Performance improvements
- v25.2.0: Additional protocol extensions
- v26.0.0: Next major feature release
